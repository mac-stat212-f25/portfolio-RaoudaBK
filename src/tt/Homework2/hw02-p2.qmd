## Instructions

**Task:** Open up the New York Times article [A Summer of Strikes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/03/business/economy/strikes-union-sag-uaw.html), and scroll down to the plot titled "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades (Share of the work force in a union, by industry)".

![](https://hash-mac.github.io/stat212site-f25/images/challenge-2-goal.png)

Using `ggplot2` and other tools in R, recreate this plot. Note that you will need to create the data underlying the plot yourself. You can create this data in R with `tibble()`. You can also write the data in Excel or Google Sheets and export it as a CSV file.

**Requirements:**

- Overall
  - Panels for "All workers", "By Sector", and "By Industry" are shown.
  - Arrows showing the change from 1983 to 2022 are shown.
    - Note: be sure that the arrows all point in the correct direction!
  - The actual percentages in 1983 and 2022 are shown as text.
  - X-axis tick marks are at 0, 25, and 50.
  - Plot title says "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades".
  - Plot subtitle says "Share of the work force in a union, by industry".
- Resource reflection
    - At least 1 resource is listed
    - At least 3 sentences about resources and their helpfulness in the task

**Bonus**: Additional possibilities to enhance your visualization include adjusting the default aesthetics of the arrows, aligning your plots neatly, and adding margins in order to left-align the y-axis text. 



## Setup

```{r}
# Code for loading packages
# And code for reading in data if using the Excel/Google Sheets-->CSV approach
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Code for generating the data (if using the tibble() approach)
# Create the dataset
union_data <- tibble(
  group = c("All workers", 
            "Private sector", "Public sector",
            "Transportation and utilities", "Manufacturing", "Mining",
            "Construction", "Education and health", "Arts, entertainment and recreation",
            "Business services", "Retail, food and hospitality", "Public administration",
            "Agriculture"),
  category = c("All", 
               "Sector", "Sector",
               "Industry","Industry","Industry",
               "Industry","Industry","Industry",
               "Industry","Industry","Industry",
               "Industry"),
  start_1983 = c(20, 17, 37, 47, 28, 27, 28, 26, 17, 10, 8, 30, 5),
  end_2022   = c(10, 6, 33, 16, 8, 7, 13, 17, 7, 3, 3, 28, 4)
)
```




## Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(union_data) +
  # Arrows
  geom_segment(aes(x = end_2022, xend = start_1983,
                   y = fct_rev(group), yend = fct_rev(group)),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, "inches"), type = "closed"),
               color = "steelblue", size = 0.6) +
  
  # 2022 labels 
  geom_text(aes(x = end_2022, y = fct_rev(group),
                label = paste0(end_2022, "%")),
            hjust = 1.2, vjust = 0.4, size = 3, color = "black") +
  
  # 1983 labels 
  geom_text(aes(x = start_1983, y = fct_rev(group),
                label = paste0(start_1983, "%")),
            hjust = -1.2, vjust = 0.4, size = 3, color = "black") +
  
  # Facets
  facet_wrap(~category, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1,
             labeller = labeller(category = c(
               "all" = "ALL WORKERS",
               "sector" = "BY SECTOR",
               "industry" = "BY INDUSTRY"))) +
  
  # X-axis
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 60), 
                     breaks = c(0, 25, 50),
                     labels = c("0%", "25%", "50%")) +
  
  labs(
    title = "Union membership has fallen sharply over the past four decades",
    subtitle = "Share of the work force in a union, by industry",
    x = NULL, y = NULL,
    caption = "Source: Current Population Survey, via unionstats.com"
  ) +
  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +
  theme( panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", size = 11),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 13),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, margin = margin(b = 10)),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 8, color = "darkgrey", hjust = 0),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 9)
  )

```

## Resources Reflection (required)

List the resources you used to help with this assignment then write 3-5 sentence reflection on which resources were most helpful in finishing this task.

**Resources:**

- R for Data Science, Chapter on Data Visualization
- ggplot2 documentation (for geom_segment(), geom_text(), and facet_wrap())
- Stack Overflow discussions on aligning labels and adjusting hjust

**Reflection:**
The most helpful resource for me was the R for Data Science chapter on data visualization because it gave me a clear reminder of how to structure plots in ggplot2. I also found the official ggplot2 documentation useful, especially for understanding how to control arrows with geom_segment() and how to position text labels. Finally, looking at Stack Overflow helped me troubleshoot small alignment issues, like how to adjust hjust so the percentages didnâ€™t overlap with the arrows. Together these resources made it much easier to recreate the New York Times plot in a way that looks clean and readable
